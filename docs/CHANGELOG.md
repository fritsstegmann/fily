# Fily Documentation Changelog

## Version 1.2 - July 26, 2025

### Major Updates: Environment Variable Configuration Migration

#### Updated Documents

**[docs/README.md](README.md)**
- Added DOCKER.md to the documentation index
- Updated SECURITY_AUDIT.md status to v1.2 (all critical/high vulnerabilities resolved)
- Added new "Deployment and Operations" section

**[docs/DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md)** - NEW
- Comprehensive Docker deployment guide
- Environment variable configuration for containers
- Development and production Docker Compose examples
- Multi-tenant deployment with multiple AWS credentials
- Security hardening and monitoring best practices
- Container orchestration and scaling guidance

**[docs/S3_VERSIONING_DESIGN.md](S3_VERSIONING_DESIGN.md)**
- Updated configuration section to use environment variables instead of TOML
- Replaced config.toml examples with environment variable examples
- Added environment variable loader implementation example
- Updated implementation checklist to reference environment variables
- Changed "TOML parsing updates" to "Environment variable parsing updates"

#### Configuration System Migration Impact

The migration from TOML-based configuration to environment variables affects future implementations:

1. **All new features** should use environment variable configuration
2. **Legacy TOML references** in design documents have been updated
3. **Docker deployment** now fully supported with environment variables
4. **Multi-credential support** enables enterprise deployment scenarios

#### Unchanged Documents

**[docs/SECURITY_AUDIT.md](SECURITY_AUDIT.md)**
- Already updated to v1.2 in previous commits
- No configuration-related security changes needed
- Environment variables improve security posture

**[docs/PERFORMANCE_REPORT.md](PERFORMANCE_REPORT.md)**
- Performance analysis remains valid
- No configuration-specific performance impacts
- Environment variables have minimal performance overhead

**[docs/S3_COMPATIBILITY_GAP_ANALYSIS.md](S3_COMPATIBILITY_GAP_ANALYSIS.md)**
- S3 API compatibility analysis unchanged
- Code examples use Config struct (implementation detail)
- No impact on S3 compatibility assessment
