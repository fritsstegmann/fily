## ✅ Resolved Critical Vulnerabilities

### ~~1. Timing Attack Vulnerability~~ (RESOLVED)

**Previous Location:** `src/fily/auth.rs:202-207`, `src/fily/auth.rs:294-299`  
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - Fixed in commit 39bd578  

**Resolution Action:**
Implemented constant-time signature comparison using the `subtle` crate to prevent timing attacks.

**Applied Fix:**
```rust
use subtle::ConstantTimeEq;

// Compare signatures using constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks
let signatures_match: bool = expected_signature
    .as_bytes()
    .ct_eq(signature_components.signature.as_bytes())
    .into();

if !signatures_match {
    error!("Signature verification failed - authentication denied");
    // Do not log signatures to prevent cryptographic material exposure
    return Err(AuthError::SignatureVerificationFailed);
}
```

**Previous Impact:**
