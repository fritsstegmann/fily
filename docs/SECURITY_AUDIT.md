## Executive Summary

This security audit examines the Fily S3-compatible file storage server implementation. The audit identifies several critical and high-severity vulnerabilities that require immediate attention, particularly in authentication mechanisms and file handling. A significant security improvement was made by removing hardcoded credentials from the pre-signed URL functionality.

### Risk Level: **MEDIUM-HIGH** (Improved from HIGH)

**Critical Issues:** 1 (Reduced from 2)  
**High Severity:** 3 (Reduced from 4)  
**Medium Severity:** 6  
**Low Severity:** 3  

**Recent Security Improvements:**
- ✅ **Removed hardcoded credentials** from pre-signed URL generation (Critical → Resolved)
- ✅ **Eliminated pre-signed URL attack vector** by removing functionality entirely
- ✅ **Clean git history** established to prevent credential exposure

## Methodology

The audit was conducted through:
- Static code analysis of all source files
- Security-focused review of authentication mechanisms
- File handling and path traversal vulnerability assessment
- Input validation and sanitization review
- Encryption implementation analysis
- Configuration security review
- Git history analysis for embedded secrets

## Critical Vulnerabilities

### 1. Timing Attack Vulnerability (CRITICAL)

**Location:** `src/fily/auth.rs:202-207`, `src/fily/auth.rs:294-299`  
**CVSS Score:** 8.1 (High)  
**Status:** UNRESOLVED

**Description:**
String comparison for signature validation uses non-constant-time operations, allowing timing attacks to leak signature information.

```rust
if expected_signature != signature_components.signature {
    error!("Signature verification failed!");
    // ... logging sensitive data
}
```

**Impact:**
- Attackers can determine correct signatures through timing analysis
- Complete authentication bypass possible
- Affects all authenticated requests

**Recommendation:**
Implement constant-time comparison using cryptographic libraries:
```rust
use subtle::ConstantTimeEq;
if expected_signature.as_bytes().ct_eq(signature_components.signature.as_bytes()).into() {
    // Success
} else {
    // Failure - no logging of signatures
}
```

## ✅ Resolved Critical Vulnerabilities
